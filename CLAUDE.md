# Project Guidelines for Claude

## Communication Preferences

- **Always ask before guessing**: When requirements are unclear or ambiguous, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to clarify instead of making assumptions.
- Interview the user to understand their intent when:
  - The task has multiple valid interpretations
  - Implementation details aren't specified
  - There are architectural decisions to make
  - The scope or boundaries of a task are unclear
